**optiflow** is an algorithm designed to reconstruct **velocity fields** from **kymographs** with **optimal transport**. Indeed, optimal transport computes the velocity field of minimal work, which is relevant under a wide array of situations and does not necessitates hard physical assumptions, except for the conservation of the physical quantity that we are measuring across time.
This software is designed to offer cell biologists a simple method to obtain flow fields around a membrane contour (taking into account boundary conditions) for free, offering a quantitative measurement for a flow that can only be observed visually otherwise.

## Example
<img src="Images/optiflow_example.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>


```shell
pip install optiflow

```

```py
from optiflow import define_matrices, compute_displacements_from_kymograph,plot_vector_field

## Load the kymograph
K = np.load("Kymograph_example.npy")
nt =  len(K)

#Define the distance matrices (we use circular boundary condition) and compute the displacements
C,D = define_matrices(npoints = nt,plot=True)
V = compute_displacements_from_kymograph(K,C,D)

#Visualize 
vmin = min(np.abs(V.min()),V.max())
plt.imshow(V.clip(-vmin,vmin),plt.cm.bwr,extent = (0,1,0,1))
plot_vector_field(V,t=7,pool_size = 25)

### API and Documentation

#### The kymograph K 
By convention, the kymograph `K` is a `nb * nt` matrix, where nb is the number of bins used to discretize the space, and nt is the number of time points. 


- `define_matrices(npoints, plot=False)` computes the distance and cost matrices according to the kymograph. 
    - `return C,D`, where `C` is the cost matrix and `D` is the distance matrix


#### Computation of displacement fields from kymographs
- `compute_displacements_from_kymograph(K,C,D)` compute the displacement field using optimal transport
	- `return V`, a `nb * (nt-1)` matrix of the velocity fields inferred.
